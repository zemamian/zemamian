### Hi, I’m Zahra 👋

I’m a software engineer with a strong focus on backend development, product thinking, and building things that actually get used.

I started my career working on real-world systems early on — from municipal platforms to academic and healthcare-related dashboards — and after my BSc in Computer Engineering, I chose to build instead of continuing straight into academia. I co-founded a software company(<a href="https://karinco.ir">Karin<a/>) where I mainly worked on backend architecture, data-heavy systems, and decision-making around products, not just code.

Most of my experience is in:
- Backend development (Laravel, PHP, RESTful APIs)
- Data-driven systems and dashboards
- Designing maintainable architectures
- Turning ideas into working products

Currently, I’m exploring ways to:
- Build more independent, sustainable products
- Work on internationally scoped projects
- Combine technical work with writing and analysis

I mostly work with:
- Laravel / PHP
- Python (for data-related tasks)
- Angular
- Git, Linux-based environments

If something here resonates, feel free to explore my repositories or reach out.

Thanks for stopping by.
